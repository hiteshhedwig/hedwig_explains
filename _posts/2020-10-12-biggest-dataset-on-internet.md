# What are we doing? And Why?
If you are a datascientist or computer vision researcher who always looking for neat image  or any sort of dataset because it's sometimes so hard to find right dataset for you. In this post, i am sharing some resources which would be super helpful for you. I will also show the right way to download them in case of **`Google Open Image Dataset`**. What right way you may ask? It's simply a python script which will do the job for you. You don't need to rush in anyway. 

# Open Images Dataset V6

When i was starting out from scratch. It was quite difficult to know from where to download the dataset. Or if that dataset right for you. Open Images Dataset V6 by Google is an amazing source to download the data.

You can find it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/visualizer/index.html?set=train&type=detection&c=%2Fm%2F0pg52). There will be plethora of categories in the dropdown menu. It would look something like this.

## Brief

As you can see, the category for this tutorial i have chosen is taxi. You may chose anything else, Ofcourse!. There are several filters on the top of red bar in the website which is important to know about. Like:

- Subset : (Train, Validation)
- Type: (Detection, Segementation)

Subset is only to show you the content which will be downloaded if you download train or validation filtered data. 

Type is crucial, it will give you whatever type of problem deal with. For example, for this example we have used detection. So the images we are getting is bounding boxes. If you switch it to, segmentation you get segemented image. As simple as that.


## How to download?

It's quite difficult to ambigous to download from the website. But fortunately we have tool which makes it easy to one liner!

We use a tool name `OIDv4_ToolKit` available on [github](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/OIDv4_ToolKit). It makes is fairly easy to download images.

Cloning the github repo.

 > 📝 Note: If you are running the command in a terminal. Omit "!" .

```
> git clone https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/OIDv4_ToolKit.git 
Cloning into 'OIDv4_ToolKit'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 444, done.
remote: Total 444 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 444
Receiving objects: 100% (444/444), 34.09 MiB | 35.95 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (157/157), done.
```
Moving inside directory and extracting some files. You don't need to bother much about this, just copy paste and run on your machine. 

```
> cd OIDv4_ToolKit/
> curl "https://d1vvhvl2y92vvt.cloudfront.net/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
> unzip awscliv2.zip
> sudo ./aws/install
```
Now, here comes the magic. One command where you specify :

- `class` : In our case, we will download `Taxi` images. You can download multiple classes by just typing class one after another.
- `type_csv`: Do you want to download train data? Validation data?
- `limit`: How many images we want to download? I am downloading 100 as an example.

```
> python main.py downloader --classes Taxi --type_csv train --limit 100

# Sample image from data

Now it has been downloaded. Dataset will be downloaded in the file `/OID/Dataset/train/`
Let's see the sample image?

```
> from PIL import Image
> Image.open('/content/OIDv4_ToolKit/OID/Dataset/train/Taxi/23274c285653cc1c.jpg')
```

So it looks pretty good! Remember i have only downloaded 100 images. You can download with any limit. If its available on dataset. It will be downloaded. We also have bounding boxes in labels folder.

> ⚡ Tip: csv file have been downloaded in `csv_folder`. You can use it as pandas dataframe for more flexible usage of data. 

# Open Public datasets
As a data scientist, you dont always deal with image dataset. So, this [Github](https://github.com/hiteshhedwig/awesome-public-datasets) Repo got very detailed list of every dataset for gamut of professions.

[![dataset.png](https://i.postimg.cc/0yLzbkNt/dataset.png)](https://postimg.cc/YvzrPwYg)

> ⚡ Tip: If you are new to github. You can fork it and contribute to it as well.

# Amazon, Google, Microsoft Public Dataset

Waait.. we just discussed google dataset a while ago. That was especially for image based problems. Incase you want to research for the data yourself that you struggling to find. The [Google Dataset Search engine](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) will help you to research more about it.

Like Google, [Amazon](https://registry.opendata.aws/) also have some public dataset to help you with your research. 

And so do, [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/open-datasets/catalog/) .

Datasets we have discussed so far. They will definitely provide the edge you looking for (if you look correctly). They are almost all you need. Although there are sites like kaggle, datatruks but as we have mentioned google dataset engine. It automatically directs you to the sites.
