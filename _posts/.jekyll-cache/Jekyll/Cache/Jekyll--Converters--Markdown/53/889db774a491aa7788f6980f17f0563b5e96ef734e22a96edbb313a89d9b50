I"å.<h1 id="what-are-we-doing-in-this-blog">What are we doing in this blog?</h1>

<p>We are changing folders name like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Folder Name from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n02113023-Pembroke</code> Changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pembroke</code></li>
  <li>Folder Name from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n02113624-toy_poodle</code> Changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Toy Poodle</code></li>
  <li>Folder Name from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n02115641-dingo</code> Changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dingo</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If want to learn this, Go on with reading:</p>

<p>In this, dataset directory. I have downloaded, famous standford <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/">dataset</a>. The Stanford Dogs dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization.</p>

<p>The name of the folders (which will be used as classes while training) have names like, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n02093256-Staffordshire_bullterrier</code>. We definitely don‚Äôt want our class to be like that but rather simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Staffordshire Bullterrier</code>. The python script will get rid of any weird characters that are unneccessary.</p>

<p>Now, we have our path defined where the data is situated. In my case, i had uploaded it to google drive. Time consuming upload, avoid it if possible.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say we have folder name like this:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n02093256-Staffordshire_bullterrier</code></p>

<p>Here is our process of obtaining what we want,</p>
<ul>
  <li>We first split on the basis of  - (hyphen) charachter</li>
  <li>Then we obtain list like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">['n02093256' , 'Staffordshire_bullterrier']</code></li>
  <li>After that, we use slicing technique to select second index.</li>
  <li>Then after we have what we wanted, we can simply again split on the basis of  _ (underscore)</li>
  <li>Then we obtain something like this:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">['Staffordshire','bullterrier']</code></li>
  <li>After we have what we wanted we can simply join the list back. And use capitalize to make first letter of word capitalize.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>üìù Note: This code will need to be modified according to the folder name you are dealing with.</p>
