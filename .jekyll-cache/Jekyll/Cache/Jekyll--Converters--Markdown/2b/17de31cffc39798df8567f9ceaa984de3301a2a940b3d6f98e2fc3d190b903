<h1 id="brief-">Brief :</h1>
<p>As title suggests, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">An Era of Ignorance</code>. I believe, we live in the era of Ignorance. Where we believe something..do something And both contradicts. Totally lacking the clarity about world. For example: Everyone wants of buy a ferarri, BMW, Jaguar etc. And at the sametime, they want to conserve nature too. Do things work like that? I don’t believe so. I will be sharing some of my understanding on the topic.</p>

<p>Well, among all the chaos going on. We sure do not have proper description about clarity. We even may remember number of times when we were clear about something. Because, it’s so minimal and countable that probably easy to remember. By clarity i mean, pin pointness toward the target. When you are so clear about what you believe in that everything becomes breeze only your belief stand firm like mountain.</p>

<p>People (or maybe including me) really really want to save climate –but do not want to sacrifice enough what it takes in their life to do so.</p>

<h1 id="scratching-the-surface-">Scratching the surface :</h1>

<p>Comfort level has killed our ability to make a difference. I often hear people say, “I want to earn lots of money”. When money becomes utmost purpose of life. Then there is something wrong. Money is important like anything else in life. My only point is, when it is whole purpose of life. You will try earning it by any means possible and in some cases some ‘means’ could lead to catastrophic results.</p>

<p>When your whole purpose of life is to make a difference then ‘earning money’ automatically becomes part of your endeavour. There are layers that you would need to unveil.</p>

<p>When we hear the word ethics. It will depend what ‘ethics’ you subscribe to. So, it’s understandable that defination and form of ethics may vary from people to people. ~ BUT Is it so? Is there no real form of ethics? Is it just subjective to people? Definitely, there is a difference between stepping on the foot of a begger and giving them food. There is a difference. Indeed. There is only one form of ethics which is real. So real that it gives you peace.</p>

<p>Imagine, you are standing infront of 2 mirrors. Facing each other. If you look into the mirrors. You will see thousands of ‘you’. It doesn’t mean there are thousands of you in real. You are only one and real. Similarily, same with ethics. Real ethics have gone scattered amidst the fake ethics which people propose for their own comfort. Which is illusionary itself. Real ethics remains pretty much universal. Which are basis of life and peace. Morals which helps society. Which are so pure yet solid. Ethics which is devoid of hatred, disdain, discouragement, ego, etc. Which is down to earth. Hopefully, you will understand ethics are not set of rules. That can’t be memorized. They are way of life. You will learn them as you contemplate on the life situations.</p>

<h1 id="is-perfection-really-ideal-state-or-practical">Is perfection really ideal state? Or practical?</h1>
<p>I have heard people say,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“If we cannot be perfect. Why to even seek it?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We cannot be perfect. But we can be reasonably good. The idea of perfection helps us to push our limits. Doesn’t allow to be complacent. It’s same like you cannot be perfect at maths but does it mean it should be entertained with no effort of improvement?</p>

<p>Just because, you perfectly cannot help anyone doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.</p>

<p>Imagine life as a bag of balls where you have bad and good balls filled within it. (Nothing wrong with it). So, the way you will sort out bad balls out of good ones is by hit and trail. In real life, it’s theory of learning from experience. You do something. You learn from it. Then you do it better. As simple as that. Not easy though. Sadly, people misintrepet the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easy</code>. Yes, things can be simple and difficult. Going from point A to point B could be simple. Nothing complicated with that but it doesn’t have to be easy. So, something can be simple and yet difficult. And complex and yet easy.</p>

<p>Similarly, to be less ignorant and more concious in our life. It’s practice. Practice of contemplation. Thinking everytime from every possible dimension. And most importantly, always looking to improve.</p>

<h1 id="how-perception-is-the-key-">How perception is the key ?</h1>

<p>You can’t control what’s coming to you. But you can <em>control</em> how you handle it. Someone can make fun of east asian about squinting eyes. But when someone really takes in good spirit then even people who do it with the purpose of disdain they lose. Not that i say people who make this racist mark are not problem. But, those people are always going to be there. We can’t do anything about. But, if we understand that they are doing due to some limited capabilites then it becomes funny, childish.</p>

<p>Most of the situation in life would be defined by how we take a particular situation as. Either, we could unleash the wrath. Or, we can be calm. Every situation demands different from us. In some, we need to be in wrath. Calmness would only do damage. And in some, calmness is silver bullet. Everything is situation dependent.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Asking ourselves, 
What this situation demand us from?
What would be the best thing to do? 
Can i see more deep in the situation intricacies?<br />
…. and so on..</p>

<p>There is a saying that, Anger burns the person itself. Mostly in life, the situation we would encounter, most of them need no involvement of anger whatsoever. When someone being mean to you and you feeling angry, tell yourself that other person is still in learning process. Or, Maybe person is having a bad day. 
Anything that may help you to feel compassion toward that being. Perception is not an angle. It’s a state where you able to see everything in clarity. Being said that, perception it’s attained throughout life experiences. As we all are in some kind of learning process.</p>
